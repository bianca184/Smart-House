# Smart-House
Smart House Automation is a software project that simulates and controls several virtual smart homes. The application is built with a Spring Boot backend and a custom interface using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Its purpose is to offer an interactive representation of each house, allowing the user to control lighting, temperature and heating in real time. Each house stored in the database has its own name, current temperature, desired temperature, light state and heating state. The backend exposes endpoints that allow the interface to read and update these values. A scheduled simulator updates the temperature every few seconds, increasing or decreasing it depending on whether the heating system is active. When the user sets a desired temperature, the system automatically decides when the boiler should turn on or off, creating a realistic simulation of home heating. The interface displays all houses visually. Each house appears as an exterior image and includes icons showing whether the light or the heating system is active. The user can adjust the target temperature using a slider, and can toggle the light on or off with a single button. The images used for the lamp, boiler and house are transparent PNG files, allowing smooth visual changes when their states update. The dashboard refreshes regularly and reflects the current temperature values generated by the backend. Clicking on a house opens a detailed interior view. This modal presents a room layout with a sofa, a lamp and a boiler. The lamp switches between an “on” and “off” image depending on the current state. The boiler also changes appearance when it heats the room. The interior page contains the same temperature controls, allowing the user to interact with the house in a more immersive way. The visual style relies on realistic or semi-realistic images that help the user understand the state of the virtual home at a glance. The project is structured into a clear backend architecture, a MySQL database that stores persistent house data and a lightweight frontend that communicates with the server using fetch requests. This combination allows the simulation to remain simple, but visually expressive and easy to extend. The result is a functional smart home environment where temperature, lighting and heating are controlled through an intuitive interface and backed by real logic implemented on the server.
